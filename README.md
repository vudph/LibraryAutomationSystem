## Requirements
The library system should keep track of books as they are checked out, returned, put on reserve and renewed. It should enforce checkout rules (the "business logic" of the application) based on the borrowing privileges of the person checking out the library book.

The library offers books to two different types of library patrons: community patrons and patron scholars. Community patrons may check books out for 3 weeks and can have as many as 5 books checked out at a time. Patron scholars may check books out for 6 weeks and can have as many as 10 books checked out at a time. Community patrons may renew a book once for an additional 3 weeks as long as no one else has placed the book on reserve. Patron scholars may renew a book once for an additional 6 weeks as long as no one else has placed the book on reserve. Both community patrons and patron scholars may place a book on reserve.

The library may have more than one copy of the same book. The first use of the term refers to a specific copy of a book. The second use of the term refers to any one of possible several copies of a book with a specific title and author

The principle user of the system will be the librarian. The system should automate the manual functions performed today which are: check out, return, place a book on reserve, and renew a book. The system should also allow a patron or a librarian to search for a book based on title, author or key words.
